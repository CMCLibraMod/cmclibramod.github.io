Libra Mod is a rebalancing mod for the game Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum (PS2). In order to offer more challenge, replay value and monster variety, every duel in the game was rebuilt. Some duelists' elements have changed, their monster lineups have been adjusted, and the monsters and levels were strenghtened. Every duel is designed by hand, in order to offer a challenging and fun experience for players, no matter what element is picked. Another interesting feature of this mod is the presence of extra monsters, the so called "unused" ones, left incomplete by the development team. They were used in some duels -- and if you get them early on, you're lucky!

Libra Mod offers two modes of gameplay:

- Rebalanced Campaign (RC): aimed for a first playthrough. Rebuilt duels with challenge scaling -- opponents' difficulty and strength go up as the player progresses through the areas. A great work has been put in order to give each element a different experience. Several useful monsters are available for each element for retrieving after duels; some may be even at a sufficient level to perform a fusion right away, giving everyone more chances and time to test the super cool fused monsters. RC is at its final stages of development. Currently, 22 from 25 duels have been already designed. After designing, some playtests and eventual adjustments will be done.
- New Game + mode: still in early development. It will be an additional campaign for players who have finished the RC. Every duelist will be at least as strong as an endgame duelist from the RC, even the first ones. There will be an additional challenge scaling here, so do not expect these duels to be easy!!!
