Libra Mod is a rebalancing mod for the game Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum (PS2). In order to offer more challenge, replay value and monster variety, every duel in the game was rebuilt. Some duelists' elements have changed, their monster lineups have been adjusted, and the monsters and levels were strenghtened. Every duel is designed by hand, in order to offer a challenging and fun experience for players, no matter what element is picked. Another interesting feature of this mod is the presence of extra monsters, the so called "unused" ones, left incomplete by the development team. They were used in some duels -- and if you get them early on, you're lucky!

Libra Mod will offer three modes of gameplay:

- Rebalanced Campaign (RC)/New Game: aimed for a first playthrough. Rebuilt duels with challenge scaling -- opponents' difficulty and strength go up as the player progresses through the areas. A great work has been put in order to give each element a different experience. Several useful monsters are available for each element for retrieving after duels; some may be even at a sufficient level to perform a fusion right away, giving everyone more chances and time to test the super cool fused monsters. This campaign is already complete. You can play it right away by downloading the mod!
- New Game + mode: still in early development. It will be an additional campaign for players who have finished the New Game campaign. Every duelist will be at least as strong as an endgame duelist from the RC, even the first ones. There will be a Vanilla NG+ campaign, with a new challenge scaling starting from the level of endgame duelists from New Game. The difficulty will be intermediate, offering a mostly fair experience and the possibility to collect more monsters, that were not in the New Game campaign. **Currently in development**.
- Challenges system, for New Game+: if you want a harder challenge than the Vanilla NG+ or even the NG campaign, this is for you: the Challenges are a series of difficulty modifiers that you can pick to customize your New Game+ difficulty. This will add possiblities for enemies that aren't present in the standard Campaigns: stronger Symbols and monsters, changing monsters' Attributes during a duel, tighter restrictions for deploying a team, and much more. The Challenges are intended to offer a hard and unfair experience to players, to test the limits of the player and their monsters and Symbols. **Currently in early development**.
