Folks, I'd like to share with you a second experimental custom duel that I've done at CMC. [See its video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCCri2_LBbk)

I've changed the monster lineup and the symbol's element and effect strength for Bakura's stage (Area 3), aimed at a modded campaign for a first playthrough.

Building on the fact that his "signature monster" in the base game is Queen of the Autumn Leaves, his element was changed to Wood and he has a strong team of Wood and Water monsters. If I didn't have tanky monsters, I would have been wiped out!

Note: Some of Bakura's capsule elements were in factincorrect. It's an issue that I'm currently trying to solve.


Long time no see, everyone.
This is the third of a series of custom duels I've done at Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum by modding the game. This time, it's Yami Marik's duel from Area 4. I intended to make it more interesting and challenging, and suitable for a late-game duel, so I've tweaked his monster lineup, replacing some of his monsters, raised their levels and strengthened his symbol. [See a match with him here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk891u8CcGM)

The modded Yami Marik has the following monsters:

- Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1
- Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #2
- Kazejin
- Megasonic Eye (x2)
- Blast Juggler
- Sky Dragon

I've also given him a symbol Effect Strength of 100, so these monsters are quite sturdy.
