**Very important news:** Libra Mod has received a bugfix. It solves a bug that affected v0.8.4. In the first duel of a gaming session with Libra on, the Max AP value that is set for all Libra duels (999) sometimes wouldn't be correctly set, so other value was loaded, affecting gameplay for this duel.

To download it, click <a href="../../assets/Releases/Libra Mod - v0.8.5.zip">**here**</a>. For players who are starting and want to check if the mod works: Joey should have 2 Fire monsters and 2 Wind ones now. Make sure your PCSX2 executable is named "pcsx2-qt.exe", as is the standard for the most recent versions!
