**Very important news:** Libra Mod has received a retrocompatibility update, now working with ALL PCSX2 versions, both 32-bit (below 1.7) and 64 (over 1.7) bit ones. The mod also looks for installations named "pcsx2.exe", instead of only "pcsx2-qt.exe".

To download it, click <a href="../../assets/Releases/Libra Mod - v0.8.6.zip">**here**</a>. For players who are starting and want to check if the mod works: Joey should have 2 Fire monsters and 2 Wind ones now. Make sure your PCSX2 executable is named "pcsx2-qt.exe" or "pcsx2.exe"!
