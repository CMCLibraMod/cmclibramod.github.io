**Last Updates:** Yami Marik's and Shadi's duel from the Rebalanced Campaign are fully designed! Kaiba's (the final one) is halfway done! A way to change the monsters' attributes has been found, and is being used to further rebalance the game.

**Current Task:** Rebuilding Kaiba's second duel and adjusting the monsters' attributes. More info on these adjustments soon!
