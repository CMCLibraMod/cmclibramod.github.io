**BREAKING NEWS:** A **large update** has been performed on Libra Mod, following some of the players' feedbacks and implementing some ideas and adjustments I've developed myself after conducting post-release additional playthroughs.
{: .notice--success}

To download it, click <a href="../../assets/Releases/Libra Mod - v0.8.2.zip">**here**</a>. For players who are starting and want to check if the mod works: Joey should have 2 Fire monsters and 2 Wind ones now.

Here's a spoiler-free and summarized list of changes:

- Adds a fix for a bug in which the mod crashes between duels (related to a error in the graphical user interface).
- Fixes a bug in which Destroyer Golem, Kanikabuto and Winged Dragon #2 didn't appear in certain duels, although they were meant to appear.
- Adjusts the probabilities for the rare monster drops. Players are more likely to find at least one rare version of a duel now.
- Adds 3 additional unused monsters as rare drops.
- The extra versions of duels with rare drops are harder.
- One rare drop monster from Area 4 has been relocated to Area 3.
- Updates most duels' monster lineups, making them more challenging and varied.
- Adjusts the rebelancing for all elements, aiming to make the experience fairer.
- Adjusts some SPAs' level requirements. Some of them are higher, since their monsters are obtained at high levels.
- Creates new SPAs for some elements, in order to fill some efficiency gaps. These SPAs have blank names!
- Some already existing SPAs have received adjustments in range and power (mostly buffs).
- Nerfs some monsters that were too strong and easily obtainable.

For each element, the most important changes are:
- Earth:
- - Improves DFs of some monsters, so that they receive greater bonuses from Light symbols.
- - Specific Earth monsters have higher-than-average DF values, so they are better options for Light players.
- - Improves the movement and attack ranges of some monsters, in order to make them more easily usable and viable in the late-game.
- - Adds a new SPA. It has a damage effect.
- - Slightly reduces the PP values of some monsters, keeping 1000+ PPs mostly to high-level monsters
- - 2 Earth monsters are adjusted so that other elements can use them better (lower symbol effects and higher base stats). These monsters are fusion materials.
- - Some Earth support SPAs have been improved, so that they are more useful.

- Light:
- - Some monsters have been adjusted to have greater base attack and defense and lower symbol effects. That makes them great offensive and defensive options for Light symbols, without losing usefulness to Earth and without being broken.
- - Light receives additional tank monsters.
- - Light has now some monsters with reduced Map effects, so they can used better in duels with strong Dark effects.
- - Light monsters receive additional support SPAs that fill some gaps at mid and late-game, for example a stronger map effect SPA. These SPAs are in monsters that did not originally have SPAs.
- - Healing SPAs have been improved, so that they are more useful.
- - A Light monster who would only be accessible at King Coliseum is now accessible through an Area 4 duel, in order to fill a support gap.
- - Some SPA level requirements have been raised, for monsters that are already obtained in high levels.

- Wind:
- - Gaia the Dragon Champion receives attack damage and attack range nerfs. Don't worry, though: it's still a pretty strong piece. Its fusion materials are slightly harder to obtain, too.
- - Thousand Dragon receives a damage nerf. Its materials do not appear so often, too.
- - Two late-game Wind options from the shop are significantly improved. One is specialized in offense and the other is specialized in defense and support. The offense option receives a mobility SPA and the support option receives a support SPA. Those monsters did not originally have SPAs.
- - Killer Needle, which was an underwhelming monster, receives adjustments to give it an specific utility now.
- - One of the added unused monsters for the "treasure hunt" is a Wind monster!
- - Other monsters have received slight adjustment to offer a fairer experience when playing as Wind and against Wind.
- - Wind players will benefit from some changes in Fire monsters! See below.

- Fire:
- - Fire receives additional defensive options. These monsters have lower Symbol bonuses, but higher base attacks and good defenses. These monsters help Wind players when setting up a defensive team.
- - Fire also receives some extra offensive options that can be used by other elements, with low Symbol rates and high attacks.
- - Attack and movement ranges were improved for some monsters, so they can be more useful.
- - Two Fire pieces receive new support SPAs.
- - Late-game monsters receive defense and life point bonuses, so they can survive better. They also receive improved Symbol effects.
- - A Fire rare monster has appeared in this update!

- Wood:
- - Some monsters receive improved movement/attack ranges, including two monsters who are fusion materials.
- - Great Moth and Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth (PUGM) have reduced Map effects now (100% instead of 150%).
- - PUGM has received an attack range nerf, so players have to use it more strategically. In compensation, it receives an attack buff, a SPA damage buff and a slightly lower AP cost.
- - Some monsters have improved DF values.

- Water:
- - Suijin has had its attack slightly lowered.
- - Some monsters have improved movement/attack ranges.
- - There are more options with good attack/defense values.
- - Two Water monsters with support roles have been buffed, so that they can survive, attack and level up better.

- Dark:
- - Late-game Dark monsters receive a DF buff, so they don't die so easily.
- - A Dark rare monster has appeared in this update!
- - 3 Dark monsters receive useful SPAs. The first is for support, the second is offensive and the third one has various effects.
- - Some Dark monsters have been relocated, so that they are accessible earlier through duels.
- - Dark players will benefit from some changes in Thunder monsters! See them below.

- Thunder:
- - Early-game Thunder monsters have received stat buffs, in order to make the early game for Thunder and Dark symbols smoother.
- - Some Thunder monsters have received range improvements.
- - There are more Thunder monsters with good defensive values, which benefit from Dark's defense boost.
- - Thunder has now some options that may be used by other elements, with lower Symbol effects and good base stats.
- - Kaminari Attack's fusion can be obtained more easily.
- - A Thunder monster has received a mobility SPA. 

I'm keeping in secret the exact monsters that have received some adjustments, so that players can find out by themselves the usefulness of each piece and the new SPA effects, have fun with them and share the info among themselves.
I incentivize everyone to test every piece and level them up to see what surprises they offer! Have fun!
