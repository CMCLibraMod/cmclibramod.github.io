To download it, click <a href="../../assets/Releases/Libra Mod - v0.8.4.zip">**here**</a>. For players who are starting and want to check if the mod works: Joey should have 2 Fire monsters and 2 Wind ones now. Make sure your PCSX2 executable is named "pcsx2-qt.exe", as is the standard for the most recent versions!
