Hello, everyone. This is the fourth duel made with the mod that I'm sharing with you, and a duel I've been waiting for a long time to become reality. And, after a lot of work, it's done! I had a lot of fun making it. It's the second Pegasus duel, from the final area. Check its video 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk891u8CcGM).

Pegasus is a pretty cunning duelist, and, with the mystical powers of the Millennium Eye, he has the ability to read players' intentions. Thus, in this duel, thanks to the also mystical powers of *game modding*, his powers can truly manifest themselves! In this stage, Pegasus counters the players' choice of monsters. For example, in this video, he counters my Thunder/Dark monsters with strong Earth/Light ones. He also uses the field changing abilities of this stage to strengthen his monsters or weaken mine.

Can "Yugi boy" beat such a formidable opponent?

There are also four extra monsters that are not in the original collection. Those are the unused monsters, that are incomplete. However, their data is still in the game. Some of them have 3D models of pieces, while some don't, like Panther Warrior. The extra monsters in this duel are my B. Skull Dragon and Pegasus's Ill Witch, Airknight Parshath and Panther Warrior.

I'm planning to do a future video with more information on all unused monsters that are available in the game.

I'm also happy to announce that the progress on the modding tool is coming fairly quickly. Most bugs and tests have already been done. 21 of 25 duels have already been designed!

See you in the next post and video!
