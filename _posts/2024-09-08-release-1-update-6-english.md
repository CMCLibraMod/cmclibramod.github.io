**Very important news:** Libra Mod has received an update, with two bug fixes and a small quality of life improvement.
{: .notice--success}

This update:
- fixes crashes that occurred after matches (most often after surrendering and returning to the stage selection and after specific duels, such as Yami Marik 1 or 2), for PCSX2 versions from 1.7 onwards.
- fixes a bug in which Bandit Keith's rare duel did not have the proper Symbol Effect Strength.
- adds a notification sound for when you get into a rare duel. Make sure the attached .wav file remains in the same directory as the mod, for it to work!

To download it, click <a href="../../assets/Releases/Libra Mod - v0.8.7.zip">**here**</a>. For players who are starting and want to check if the mod works: Joey should have 2 Fire monsters and 2 Wind ones now. Make sure your PCSX2 executable is named "pcsx2-qt.exe" or "pcsx2.exe"!
