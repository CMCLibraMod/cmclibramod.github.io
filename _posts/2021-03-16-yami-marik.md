Long time no see, everyone.
This is the third of a series of custom duels I've done at Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum by modding the game. This time, it's Yami Marik's duel from Area 4. I intended to make it more interesting and challenging, and suitable for a late-game duel, so I've tweaked his monster lineup, replacing some of his monsters, raised their levels and strengthened his symbol. [See a match with him here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXnhWw5fgxs)

The modded Yami Marik has the following monsters:

- Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1
- Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #2
- Kazejin
- Megasonic Eye (x2)
- Blast Juggler
- Sky Dragon

I've also given him a symbol Effect Strength of 100, so these monsters are quite sturdy.
