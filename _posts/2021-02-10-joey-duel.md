Hello, folks. I am currently working on custom duels on Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum, in order to build custom and rebalanced campaign modes. This video is of me playing through a custom buffed up Joey duel (the first stage of the game), aimed at players who have already finished the game and have access to strong late-game monsters. [See its video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6-7aWR4sA)
