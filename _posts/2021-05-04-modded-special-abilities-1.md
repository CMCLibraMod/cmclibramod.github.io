**Last Updates:** A MAJOR breakthrough has been done: the data on SPAs has been finally located. I have also learned how to edit most of it, so Libra Mod can change almost everything: ranges, costs, amount of uses, strength and effects. The effects can be chosen from the ones implemented by the game's development team, but they can be strengthened. There's also one form of hybridizing SPAs, adding a certain extra effect to some SPAs that are compatible with it. Some examples of SPA editing can be seen in the video below, which also shows Darkfire Dragon's secret SPA.

**Current Tasks:** Finish the studies on SPA data and hybridization possibilities, an additional round of rebalancing, now considering the SPAs - which may be weakened or strenghtened - and playtests.
