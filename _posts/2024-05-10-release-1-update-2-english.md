**News:** A **small fix** has been performed on Libra Mod, for players that have experienced issues with the graphical interface not showing up completely, appearing cropped. Now you can resize the window by clicking and dragging its borders, or by maximizing it.

To download it, click <a href="../../assets/Releases/Libra Mod - v0.8.3.zip">**here**</a>. For players who are starting and want to check if the mod works: Joey should have 2 Fire monsters and 2 Wind ones now.
