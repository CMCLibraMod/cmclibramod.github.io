Folks, I'd like to share with you a second experimental custom duel that I've done at CMC. [See its video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCCri2_LBbk)

I've changed the monster lineup and the symbol's element and effect strength for Bakura's stage (Area 3), aimed at a modded campaign for a first playthrough.

Building on the fact that his "signature monster" in the base game is Queen of the Autumn Leaves, his element was changed to Wood and he has a strong team of Wood and Water monsters. If I didn't have tanky monsters, I would have been wiped out!

Note: Some of Bakura's capsule elements were in factincorrect. It's an issue that I'm currently trying to solve.
